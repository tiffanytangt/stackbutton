/**
 * `build`
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This Grunt tasklist will be executed if you run `sails www` or
 * `grunt build` in a development environment.  It generates a
 * folder containing your compiled assets, e.g. for troubleshooting
 * issues with other Grunt plugins, bundling assets for an Electron
 * or PhoneGap app, or deploying your app's flat files to a CDN.
 *
 * Note that when running `sails www` in a production environment (with the
 * `NODE_ENV` environment variable set to 'production') the `buildProd` task
 * will be run instead of this one.
 *
 * For more information see:
 *   http://sailsjs.org/documentation/anatomy/my-app/tasks/register/build-js
